    "## 🎯 What is Lemmatization?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatization** is an advanced text normalization technique that transforms words into their **dictionary base form** (called **lemma**) using vocabulary and morphological analysis. Unlike stemming, lemmatization always produces real, valid words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 Simple Definition:\n",
    "> *\"Lemmatization is the intelligent way of reducing words to their meaningful base form using linguistic knowledge.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Output** | Always a valid dictionary word |\n",
    "| **Method** | Uses vocabulary + morphological analysis |\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | ✅ High - understands context and meaning |\n",
    "| **Speed** | 🐢 Slower than stemming (requires dictionary lookup) |\n",
    "| **Knowledge Base** | Uses WordNet lexical database |\n",
    "| **Context-Aware** | ✅ Yes - considers part of speech |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Examples: The Power of Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Verb Forms\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original:  running, runs, ran, runner\n",
    "Stemming:  run, run, ran, runner  ❌ (inconsistent)\n",
    "Lemmatization: run, run, run, run  ✅ (all to base form)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Adjectives\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original:  better, best, good\n",
    "Stemming:  better, best, good  ❌ (no reduction)\n",
    "Lemmatization: good, good, good  ✅ (semantic root!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3: Context Matters\n",
    "```\n",
    "Word: \"saw\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a noun (tool):     saw → saw\n",
    "As a verb (past):     saw → see  ✅ (context-aware!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 4: Complex Forms\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original:  studies, studying, studied\n",
    "Stemming:  studi, studi, studi  ❌ (not real words)\n",
    "Lemmatization: study, study, study  ✅ (perfect!)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why is Lemmatization Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 📖 **Produces Real Words**\n",
    "- Output is always found in dictionary\n",
    "- Human-readable results\n",
    "- Better for customer-facing applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 🧠 **Semantic Understanding**\n",
    "- Understands word meaning and context\n",
    "- \"better\" → \"good\" (knows they're related!)\n",
    "- More intelligent than simple rule-based stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. 🎤 **Better for Text Generation**\n",
    "- Chatbots and conversational AI\n",
    "- Text summarization\n",
    "- Machine translation\n",
    "- Any application where output needs to be readable\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. 🔍 **Improved Accuracy**\n",
    "- More precise in information retrieval\n",
    "- Better feature extraction for ML\n",
    "- Reduced false positives in search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. 🌍 **Language Awareness**\n",
    "- Handles irregular verbs (go → went → gone)\n",
    "- Understands plurals, tenses, comparatives\n",
    "- Language-specific rules applied\n",

    "### What is WordNet?\n",
    "\n",
    "**WordNet** is a large **lexical database** of English developed at Princeton University. It's the backbone of NLTK's lemmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synsets (Synonym Sets)**\n",
    "   - Groups of words with similar meanings\n",
    "   - Example: {car, auto, automobile, machine}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Semantic Relationships**\n",
    "   - Hypernyms (more general): vehicle → car\n",
    "   - Hyponyms (more specific): car → sedan\n",
    "   - Antonyms (opposites): good ↔ bad\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parts of Speech**\n",
    "   - Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs\n",
    "   - Each with specific lemmatization rules\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Coverage**\n",
    "   - Over 155,000 words\n",
    "   - 117,000+ synonym sets\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# WordNet helps lemmatizer understand:\n",

    "## 🏷️ Understanding Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are POS Tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "**POS tags** tell the lemmatizer what type of word it's dealing with. This is **CRITICAL** because the same word can have different lemmas depending on its role in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📋 NLTK POS Tags for Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "| POS Tag | Meaning | Examples | Usage |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------|-------|\n",
    "| **'n'** | Noun | book, cat, history | Things, people, places |\n",
    "| **'v'** | Verb | run, eat, write | Actions, states |\n",
    "| **'a'** | Adjective | happy, big, blue | Describes nouns |\n",
    "| **'r'** | Adverb | quickly, very, fairly | Describes verbs/adjectives |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why POS Tags Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: The word \"saw\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Without POS (defaults to noun):\n",
    "lemmatize(\"saw\")  → \"saw\" (the tool)\n",
    "\n",
    "# With POS as verb:\n",
    "lemmatize(\"saw\", pos='v')  → \"see\" (past tense of see) ✅\n",

    "# With POS as noun:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ WRONG - Using wrong POS tag\n",
